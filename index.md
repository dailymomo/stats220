## motivation
1.I like some jokes about university.

2.I would like to make some memes to show the **status from students**.


Here is a meme I made using the R package{magic}.

*I find two pictures about *darts* and *"hard working"*. If these two pictures have different means, that would be great!

*Let major selection fit these two picture.
