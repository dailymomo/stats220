I am *Yaochen Yan*👦 from the University of Auckland🇳🇿. I love 🐕, and 🐈‍⬛. I am trying my best to study this course🧑‍🎓. Hopefully I can get a good grade. 

* This repo is for my STATS220 Assignment 1, which is a meme made byself using R.
* This meme records the combination of what I think when I choose my major and What I think when I want to purchase hoodies, which is a funny situation that many students may face. 
* When students choose their major at the beginning of uni life, students may be like drawing darts blindly. But when we want to choose new clothes such as hoodies, we are very interested to choose and we may do a lot research.
