Click [STATS220 page](https://github.com/dailymomo/stats220) to go back to my `stats220` repo.

I am Yaochen Yan from University of Auckland.

This repo is for my STATS220 Assignment 1, which is a meme made byself using R.
This meme records the combination of what I think when I choose my major and What I think when I want to purchase hoodies, which is a funny situation that many students may face.


If you want to see the details about final version of meme and source code, please see [index.md](https://github.com/dailymomo/stats220/blob/main/index.md)
